# Housing-Complex-Managment-System
Our project is about housing complex management which may play important part while ownerâ€™s want to manage their employee and members information by database and as well store the information about building vacancy while giving booking a flat for sell or rent. This system is implemented using PL/SQL language and Oracle Database. In our system there are two sites(local database) and one server who can access information in bidirectional. We have implemented till level 3 transparency and used horizontal fragmentation for the fragmentation schema.
